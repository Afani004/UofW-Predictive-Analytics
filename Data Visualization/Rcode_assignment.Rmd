## Sample Question and Solution

Use `seq()` to create the vector $(1,2,3,\ldots,10)$.

```{r}
seq(1,10)
```

## Question 1

a) Use the `seq()` function to create the vector $(5, 9, 13, \ldots, 41)$. Note that each term in this sequence is of the form 
$1 + 4n$ where $n = 1, \ldots, 10$.
```{r}
#Create a sequence of numbers from 5 to 41 in steps of 4 using the `seq()` function
my_seq <- seq(5, 41, 4)

# Print the resulting sequence to the console
print(my_seq)
```

b) Use `seq()` and `c()` to create the vector $(2, 3, 4, \ldots, 10, 9, 8, \ldots, 2)$.
```{r}
# create two sequences with an increment of 1
seq1 <- seq(2, 10, 1)
seq2 <- seq(9, 2, -1)
vec <- c(seq1, seq2) # combines two sequences of numbers in descending order.
vec # prints the resulting vector
```


c) Use `rep()` to create the vector $(1,2,3,\dots,1,2,3)$ in which the sequence $(1,2,3)$ is repeated 5 times.
```{r}
# Use rep() to repeat the sequence (1, 2, 3) five times
my_vec <- rep(1:3, times = 5)
print(my_vec)
```


d) Use `rep()` to create the vector $(1,1,\ldots,1,2,2,\ldots,2,3,3,\ldots,3)$ where each number is repeated 7 times.
```{r}
#Changes "each" to "times" as the argument name to indicate that we want each element of 1:3 to be repeated "times" number of times.
vec <- rep(1:3, times = 7)
vec
```

e) Use `rep()` to create the vector $(10,20,20,30,30,30,\ldots,100,\ldots,100)$ where $10n$ is repeated $n$ times.
```{r}
# Create a sequence from 10 to 100 in increments of 10
seq <- seq(10, 100, 10)

# Repeat each element according to its value divided by 10
vec <- rep(seq, times = seq/10)
vec
```

## Question 2

a) Compute: $$\sum_{n=1}^{100} n$$.
```{r}
# Using formula:
sum <- (100 * (100 + 1)) / 2
cat("The sum is:", sum)
```


b) Compute: $$\sum_{n=1}^{100} n^2$$
```{r}
total <- 0  # initialize total variable to zero
for (n in 1:100) {
  total <- total + n^2  # add the square of each number to the total
}
cat("The total is:", total)  # print the final total
```


c) Compute: $$\sum_{n=10}^{20} \left(\frac{2^{n}}{n} + \frac{3^{n}}{n^{3}}\right)$$
```{r}
# initialize a variable to store the summation
sum = 0

# loop through the range of values for n and add each term to the sum
for (n in 10:20) {
  sum = sum + ((2^n)/n) + ((3^n)/(n^3))
}

# print the final value of the sum
cat("The sum is:", sum)
```


d) Compute: $$\sum_{n=0}^{10} \frac{1}{n!}$$ 
Hint: Use `factorial(n)` to compute $n!$
```{r}
# Define a variable to hold the sum
sum <- 0

# Loop through n from 0 to 10
for (n in 0:10) {
  # Add 1/n! to the sum
  sum <- sum + 1/factorial(n)
}

# Print the result
cat("The sum is:", sum)
```


e) Compute: $$\sum_{n=1}^{20} \left(2n + \frac{1}{n^2}\right)$$
```{r}
# initialize sum to 0
sum <- 0

# iterate over n from 1 to 20
for (n in 1:20) {
  # add 2n + 1/n^2 to the sum
  sum <- sum + 2*n + 1/n^2
}

# print the final sum
cat("The sum is", sum)
```


## Question 3

a) Create an empty list `mylist`.
```{r}
mylist <- list()
```


b) Add a component named `aa` whose value is 42.
```{r}
mylist <- list() # create an empty list
mylist$aa <- 42 # add component aa with value 42
```


c) Add a component named `bb` whose value is the numeric vector $(1,2,\ldots,10)$.
```{r}
bb <- 1:10 # create a numeric vector from 1 to 10
```

d) Add a component named `cc` whose value is the character vector ("Hello", "CIND 123").
```{r}
# Add a component named `cc` whose value is the character vector ("Hello", "CIND 123")
mylist$cc <- c("Hello", "CIND 123")
```


e) Add a component named `dd` whose value is a 4x3 matrix whose elements are $(1,2,\ldots,12)$ in column-major order.
```{r}
# Create a 4x3 matrix with values from 1 to 12 in column-major order
dd <- matrix(1:12, nrow = 4, ncol = 3, byrow = FALSE)

# Add the matrix to your workspace with the name "dd"
mylist$dd <- dd
```


f) Display `mylist` on the screen.
```{r}
print(mylist)
```


## Question 4

If you have not already done so, install the ISwR package on
your computer using the command `install.packages("ISwR")`.

Loading the `ISwR` package into the current session.
```{r}
 library(ISwR)
```

a) Display the head of the `thuesen` data frame.
```{r}
head(thuesen)
```


b) Compute the mean of each variable using `sapply()`, removing `NA` values.
```{r}
# Compute the mean of each variable using sapply(), removing NA values.
sapply(thuesen, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```


c) Create a numeric vectors `n1`, `n2`, and `n3` whose elements are the integers from 1 to 20, their squares, and their cubes.
```{r}
n1 <- 1:20            # Create a vector of integers from 1 to 20
n2 <- n1^2            # Square each element of n1 using the ^ operator
n3 <- n1^3            # Cube each element of n1 using the ^ operator
```


d) Create a new data frame `nn` from the above three vectors.
```{r}
# Combine the three vectors into a data frame named `nn`
nn <- data.frame(n1, n2, n3)
```


e) Display the tail of `nn`.
```{r}
tail(nn)
```


f) Compute the sum of each variable in `nn` using `sapply`.
```{r}
# use sapply() to compute column sums
col_sum <- sapply(nn, sum, na.rm=TRUE)

# display the resulting vector
col_sum
```

## Question 5

a) Create a 4x4 empty matrix, i.e. all elements equal to NA, display mat1. 

```{r}
# create a 4x4 empty matrix filled with NA values
mat1 <- matrix(NA, nrow=4, ncol=4)

# display the matrix
mat1
```


b) fill the middle 4 elements with the values 'This' 'is' 'the' 'middle' and display mat1.
```{r}
# Fill the middle 4 elements with the values 'This' 'is' 'the' 'middle'.
mat1[2:3, 2:3] <- c("This", "is", "the", "middle")

# Display mat1
mat1
```
